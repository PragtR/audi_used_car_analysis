# Visualising an Audi used car dataset

Through this project I have tried to create various kinds of plots for exploratory data analysis of the dataset. 

Goal of this project:
1. Learning and applying some basic data visualisation tecniques with the help of libraries like seaborn and matplotlib
2. Understanding the basic ideas of statistics and probability through the charts
3. Analysing the pros and cons of particular types of plots
